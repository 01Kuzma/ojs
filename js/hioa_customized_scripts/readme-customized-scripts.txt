This folder contains javascripts that enhance web-pages of the OJS installation journals.hioa.no

It contains scripts used site-wide and scripts intended for specific journals.

All these customized scripts are located in 
ojs-dir/js/hioa_customized_scripts/

Most of the scripts that are intended for specific journals alter the html markup inside 
the h1 element decendant of the #headerTitle element.

This is done because the goal is to make every journal's page layout responsive to adapt to smaller
screen sizes as found on tablets and smartphones, and having a big header static image breaks 
a responsive layout.

My (hack) is to include only the name of the journal in the (Title text) field.

Then I have a unique script on a per journal basis that will change the html-markup of the <h1> 
element decendant of the #headerTitle element to allow fancy CSS styling of the page header using
only text and html markup to recreate the banner in a responsive matter.


Site-wide script: journals.hioa.no.customized.js 

This script contains enhancements intended to be used on all journals.hioa.no's pages.

- It wraps the header/banner in a homelink 
  FIXME: (however this would better be implemented in header.tpl files)

- It indicates what page you are on by adding a currentPage class to the navbar list item 
  that corresponds to the page you are viewing.

It is inserted in a <script> element in the <head> element and referenced from:
ojs-dir/lib/pkp/common/header.tpl
ojs-dir/templates/article/header.tpl


Journal Specific Scripts

Below are javascript files that need to be referenced from each journal in a <script> element.
A good place to do this can be in the footer for consistency.

How to use:
- Log in as a journal manager or site administrator and go to:
- Setup > Step 5 The Look > Journal Page Footer
- Use the HTML edit mode of the editor and add the required code at the end.
- Save!
